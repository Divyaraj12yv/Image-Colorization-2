# Visualizing the Colorization Process.

📌 Description
This project focuses on visualizing the intermediate stages of image colorization using the DeOldify model. It aims to provide insights into how grayscale images are progressively transformed into colorized versions by visualizing outputs at different stages of the model.

Understanding these transitions helps to interpret model behavior, diagnose issues, and improve transparency in AI-assisted photo restoration.

🎯 Objective
Use the DeOldify model for automatic photo colorization.

Visualize the intermediate representations (e.g., generator outputs, attention maps if available, or incremental outputs during inference).

Provide step-by-step visual feedback showing how a grayscale image becomes colorized.

🛠️ Tools and Techniques
DeOldify: A state-of-the-art model for colorizing black & white photos using GANs.

PyTorch: For model implementation.

Matplotlib / OpenCV: For visualizing images and intermediate results.

Colab/Jupyter: For running and displaying step-wise visualizations.
